# twc

This exercise was performed directly on a chef workstation.
Did not have enough time to setup a fully functional chef server and node.

In addition to learning chef, had to first learn how to setup nginx to forward to different websites based on a portion of the url.
Also had to learn how to use git to publish and share the project.
